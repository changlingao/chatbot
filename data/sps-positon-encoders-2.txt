Testing the encoders
To check if your encoders are working correctly:
- Remove the build tray
- Zero the encoders (https://support.asiga.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/zero-position-encoder.gif)
Run your finger along the edge of the basin. The blue dot should follow your finger and turn red (https://support.asiga.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/follow-frame-encoder.gif). If your position encoders are performing as described, they are working perfectly.
