Category is PRO4K. Turns on randomly additional suggestion.
For the time being, please rest assured that there will be no safety concerns if this happens.
We can only suggest if you don't use the printer overnight or during the weekend, to switch off the power at the back of the machine, so the printer doesn't turn on by itself.
