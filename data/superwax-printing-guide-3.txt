SuperWAX printing guide general CAD rules 
1. Avoid thin wire structures, these will be too brittle during post processing. SuperCAST HD or X are better suited for these kinds of structures.
2. Use the smallest supports possible, as removal of supports may damage your part.
3. Use a shadow baseplate where possible, for easy removal of parts from build platform.
4. Add as much of final spruing to your CAD design to minimize contact of delicate parts with hot wax needle. 
Turning the parts 45 degrees around Z hides artifacts from rasterization better. This will result in improved surface quality (https://support.asiga.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/45_angle_ring.png).
