Product breakdown of MAX under the hood. The Build Tray
Build trays contain the resin during the printing process. They are constructed of a flexible film within a rigid plastic frame. (https://support.asiga.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MAX-lowforce-build-tray.jpg) Do not use the same Build Tray for multiple materials as this may create material cross-contamination and transfer of uncured materials.
