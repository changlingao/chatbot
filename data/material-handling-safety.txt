Material handling & safetyâ€‹ 
When handling Asiga resins, always consult the Safety Data Sheets for appropriate safety and handling instructions. Make sure to:
- Always wear disposable nitrile gloves when handling uncured resin.
- Wash hands thoroughly in cold soapy water if skin contact with uncured resin occurs. Washing hands with IPA or other solvents is not recommended as this will dry out your skin and can cause irritation.
**Uncured resin is classified as hazardous to aquatic life**
