Category is Encoders. How to swap encoders.
Go to Maintenance> Position Encoders> Zero Position Encoders, and check whether the  encoder is showing NaN, which is not a number and not reading properly. 

This issue may be due to the encoder or the encoder board. 
1. Please turn off the printer, then unscrew the the encoder board from the printer, to make it easier to access the orange plugs.
2. Temporarily swap encoder 0 and encoder 1, and then turn the printer back on.
3. Go to Maintenance> Position Encoders> Zero Position Encoders and see if the NaN reading moves or stays in the same place. 
4. See previous picture encoder board numbered to identify encoder 0, and encoder 1 plugs.
5. It is advised to text customer support for guided process on how to swap encoders properly as it is fragile.
