Guide for fixing:
- remove the build tray from the printer and ensure the build platform is clean
- close the hood of the printer, to show LED light
- go to Maintenance> Service> LED> Calibrate Radiometer and confirm and SAVE the value, which should be 13.56
- verify if the internal UV sensor changed, go to Maintenance> Service> LED> Radiometer and check if the value reads approximately the calibrated value of 13.56
