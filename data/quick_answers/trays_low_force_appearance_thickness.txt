Category is Trays. Low force trays appearance and thickness.
The Low Force tray consists of 2 thinner films which in total are as thick as the regular tray film.
The appearance is more matte and homogeneous than the regular ones. So the parts look more beautiful, which is great for show-off prototypes and they are also slightly smoother, so it's good for casting/moulding as well.
