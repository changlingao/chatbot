Category is Trays. Tray sizes.
Asiga sells trays with different capacities for the max (1L, 2L, 5L, and 10L). If the customer prints a lot without causing damage to the tray, then they can buy a bigger tray..
Most customers choose to print with 1L trays due to potential setup issues causing damage to a tray. If a high capacity tray is damaged, it will not be possible to use all of the capacity of the tray. If you would like to order the 2L, 5L or 10L trays, please contact orders@asiga.com.
