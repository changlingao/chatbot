Category is Composer. Setting up Composer Profiles.
When Composer is installed on a PC, its accessible for all users.
Therefore for the setup profile to be the same for all users, its necessary to specify a common profile when starting composer.

If you would like to configure Composer to use a common profile folder for all users in the computer, please use the command line option --profile=c:/users/public/Composer

You can move your current profile using --profile-reset=dir

If you run Composer as the first user with --profile-reset=c:/users/public/Composer
it should save all settings into that folder.

Then all users can use --profile=c:/users/public/Composer
