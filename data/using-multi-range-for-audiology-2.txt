When would multi range be useful? 
1. To speed up the range that involves Baseplate and Supports
2. To reduce Light Intensity for the transition from cone/supports to model to extend tray life time and prevent delamination or suction cup damage
3. To speed up the part of the object that has no top surfaces with shallow angles
4. We can optionally add a range that smoothens out top surfaces with shallow angles by reducing layer thickness
