MAX Change LCD screen
To change the LCD, you just need a T10 screwdriver. With the printer turned off:
1. Remove the side panels at the bottom of the printer. 
2. You will see two screws, one on each side down at the bottom that hold the plastic front panel in place. Remove those.
3. Remove the front panel and unplug the LCD screen.
4. Remove the metal plate that keeps the LCD in place on the front panel. There are five screws holding this to the plastic front panel.
5. Remove the LCD screen, and reassemble with the replacement.
