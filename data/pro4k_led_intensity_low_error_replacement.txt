PRO4K LED intensity too low error (short version) replacement
A form is included with the replacement board, ensure you fill it out and include it with the old driver board. There will be a non-return fee of $350USD which is not payable at the time of dispatch and only becomes payable if the old board is not returned to Asiga within 30 days. Let us know once the exchange is done, so we can generate the RMA documents to return the board and remove the non-return fee once we receive it.
