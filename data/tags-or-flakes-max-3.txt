Cleaning the dirty mirror
It is possible that the mirror beneath the basin is dirty. Inspect the mirror underneath the glass basin.
If the glass is dirty:
1. Remove the basin by unscrewing these 4 screws
2. Carefully blow away the dust, being cautious not to touch the mirror as it may smudge further
3. If the mirror is too dirty, consider replacing it by contacting Asiga Support at: https://myaccount.asiga.com/accounts/support/0/
