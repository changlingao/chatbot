Category is Resins. Supercast X Whitening.
The light green colour on the printed part can be from allowing the part to be in IPA (IsoPropyl Alcohol) for cleaning too long. Please wash the part and dry it and do not leave it in IPA for a prolonged period. This will allow it to retain its colour, although if it has whitened, it is only a discolouration, and the print will not be otherwise affected.
