SuperWAX printing guide postprocessing 
1. Use an ultrasonic knife or sharp knipex to remove supports.
2. Cut the supports 0.5-1mm outside of part to prevent breakage. We suggest to cast with these support bumps and remove them from the cast metal rather than from the brittle SuperWAX.
3. Temperature of the IPA should never exceed 29°C (85°F) to prevent deformation. Cleaning should be as short as possible, please refer to the IFU.
