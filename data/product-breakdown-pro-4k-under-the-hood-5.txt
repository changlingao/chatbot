Product Breakdown for PRO 4K under the hood. The Build Tray
Build trays contain the resin during the printing process. They are constructed of a flexible film within a rigid plastic frame.

Asiga recommends one Build Tray per material. Do not use the same Build Tray for multiple materials as this may create material cross-contamination and transfer of uncured materials.
