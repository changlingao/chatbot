General Network verify wireless
To verify the connection, open a web browser on your PC and type the printer's IP address into the address bar. You should then be able to access the printer's web interface. Click on "New" and refresh the list of printers by clicking the circular arrows icon. It may take a few minutes for your printer to appear in the list. After the list refreshes, you should be able to connect to your printer by selecting it from the list.
If the printer's IP address is saved in Composer but is later changed by the router, the printer may no longer be visible to Composer. If you do not see an IP address on the Settings page, there may be a problem with your network. Please check the cabling and ensure that other devices can connect to your network without issues. If you are using a wireless connection, verify that the network name and password are correct on both the printer and the PC.
