General Return faulty parts
Note that the cost of the return of faulty parts is to be borne by the dealer, not Asiga.
Only a few faulty components ever need to be returned to Asiga such as projectors, build platforms, platform holders, internal power supplies, and basins. Fortunately these cases are only occasional. With any other faulty components its not usually needed to return them.
