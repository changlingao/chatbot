Also check which CAD design software is being used. When the dies are designed, is a clearance (horizontal shaft gap) or a cement gap added to the models? For example when using Exocad, a clearance of 20 microns would be necessary. If using 3Shape, then a cement gap of 30 microns (0.030mm) would be necessary.
