Category is trays. Trays are imperfect.
Little dimples in the build tray film are imperfections and not holes, caused by manufacturing. They can't be avoided and will be found occasionally (MAX as well as 4K). They should not be responsible for a leak in the tray. Over 95% of the damages on the build tray film are caused during usage.
