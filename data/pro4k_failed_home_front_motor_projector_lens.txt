Category is PRO4K. Failed to home front group motor message checking projector lens.
Finally, please turn off and unplug the printer. Then try to rotate the front part of the projector lens. It should turn about 1/4 of a turn. If it moves relatively freely, please turn the printer on again, clear the error message, and check if you can refresh the lens position without encountering any error.
