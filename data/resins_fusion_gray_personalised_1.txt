Category is Resins. Fusion Gray personalised recommendation step one. 
The quickest and most efficient way would be to place the build tray with the solidified/crystalised FusionGray into the microwave. It's important to remove the RFID tag from the tray before placing it into the microwave, since the RFID tag contains aluminium, and will burn out. You could peel off the RFID tag from the tray, but it is not recommended to do so as they might damage the RFID tag.
