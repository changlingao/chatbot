Why are there tags or flakes on my prints?
Extra cured material is caused by light scattering. Light scattering is an effect created when an obstacle is partially blocking the light from reaching its destination. This is caused by a dirty basin glass, a dirty mirror beneath the basin and/or a damaged build tray.
