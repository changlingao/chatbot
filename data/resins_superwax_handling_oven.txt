Category is Resins. SuperWAX handling using an oven.
Once the SuperWAX is in the tray, the recommendation would be to put it on a piece of cardboard, and heat it in an oven, (not microwave) that is at a temperature of not more than 40 C. This will take several hours, and the resin may need monitoring, and stirring along the way.
