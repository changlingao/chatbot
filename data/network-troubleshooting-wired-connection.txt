Network troubleshooting for wired connection
If you are experiencing network connection issues with a wired connection, follow the troubleshooting steps below.
Select ‘Settings’ from Main Menu and make sure ‘Automatic Configuration’ is turned on.
If there is an IP Address showing, your printer is connected to the network.

If this did not work, check the following things:
- Check the network cable for any damage or loose connections. Use a different cable if any damage is visible.
- Check the router if any lights are on. Restart the router & printer if no activity is detected.
Your printer should now be connected to your network. If this did not work, please launch a support ticket at https://myaccount.asiga.com/accounts/support/0/.
