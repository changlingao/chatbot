Category is uncategorised. Intensity is too high due to dust.
Is the printer in the same room as milling machines or possibly where gypsum models are being processed, so there's potentially lots of microdust in the room.
If so, please consider changing the location of the printer to a less dusty room.
If the internal UV sensor is reading a higher value than the actual calibrated light intensity, this will cause Composer to calculate shorter exposure times, leading to printing issues.
