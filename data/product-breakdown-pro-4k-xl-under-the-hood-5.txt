Product breakdown of PRO 4K XL under the hood. The Build Tray
Build trays contain the resin during the printing process. They are constructed of a flexible film within a rigid plastic frame. Asiga recommends one Build Tray per material. (https://support.asiga.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pro4k-build-tray.png) Do not use the same Build Tray for multiple materials as this may create material cross-contamination and transfer of uncured materials.
