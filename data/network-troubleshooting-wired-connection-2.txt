If this did not work, check the following things:
- Check the network cable for any damage or loose connections. Use a different cable if any damage is visible.
- Check the router if any lights are on. Restart the router & printer if no activity is detected.
Your printer should now be connected to your network. If this did not work, please launch a support ticket at https://myaccount.asiga.com/accounts/support/0/.
