General LCD touch screen problem
It would be good to confirm whether the problem is with the touchscreen or if it is due to the computer board freezing.
please check if you are able to access your printer by the web interface. 
Here are step by step instructions to do so:
1. Open Composer
2. Click New 
3. Select your printer and click 'ok'
4. Click on the blue globe icon
5. There is a tab front panel which will show the printers screen and then you can use the mouse to navigate.
If you are able to access the web interface, then it will clarify that the problem is only the touchscreen.
