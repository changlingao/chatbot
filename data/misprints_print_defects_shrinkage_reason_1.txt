Category is Misprints & Print Defects. Shrinkage of parts. Reasons 1.
There could be several reasons, so more information is required. What material is being used exactly? Was the fit tested right after printing and right after post curing? Sometimes post-curing can lead to distortion of the models. Has an incorrect fit been observed in the past or is this the first time being observed? Do you typically add a clearance for a good fit for parts, such as removable dies?
