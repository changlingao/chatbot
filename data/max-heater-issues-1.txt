MAX Heater issues part 1
The heater in the Max printer can reach temperatures about 10 degrees Celsius above ambient. It is tested to reach temperatures of approximately 35 degrees Celsius.
For better understanding, Asiga has conducted tests to assess the impact of temperature on a range of different resins. It has been found that temperature is not as critical as previously thought. Asiga has consequently reduced the printing temperature for most resins to 28째C or 26째C, or has disabled it altogether.
Most resins will print well within the range of 20째C to 30째C.
