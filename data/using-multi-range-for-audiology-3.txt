Sounds great, how do I start using multi range? 
Activating Multi Range is simple in the Advanced Parameters of Composer.
1. Start by opening your build
2. Open the build wizard and navigate until you get to this screen 

By default there are 2 ranges:
1. Burn-In
2. Range 1
Click Add Range to add a range.
