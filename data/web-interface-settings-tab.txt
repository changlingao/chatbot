Web interface settings tab
In the settings tab you can view, set, and lock your printer's build extents, and hide service menu features. This is a handy feature in a production environment if no settings are to be changed without authorisation.

**Asiga does not advise modifying the build extents without supervision from an authorised reseller or Asiga. Changing the build extents will cause loss of accuracy!**
