Use IsoPropyl Alcohol and a soft cloth to remove any uncured resin from the surface of the glass and wear gloves for it.

To remove any cured resin:
1.  Place a cloth soaked in IPA on top of cured resin and leave the IPA in contact with the resin for longer, which will soften it. 
2. Use a plastic scrape and soft cloth to further remove resin. Be careful not to scratch the glass.
3. After cleaning with IPA, use window cleaner to remove any streaks.
