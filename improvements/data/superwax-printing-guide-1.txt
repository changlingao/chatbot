SuperWAX printing guide general information
Superwax turns to a solid at room temperature and liquid at temperatures above 27°C (80°F). It needs to be in a liquid state for printing. The warmer SuperWax gets, the more liquid the resin becomes and the more "sticky" (higher adhesion to Teflon film) a cured layer will be.
Special Care needs to be taken when handling printed Parts. Cured SuperWax is very brittle at room temperature and becomes more brittle with lower temperatures. It becomes softer with higher temperatures. It will plastically deform at temperatures above 30°C and melt at elevated temperatures (this temperature can vary on thickness and print conditions).
