Part setup for dentistry for DentaTRY recommendations
A 100 Âµm layer thickness is recommended for try-in dentures with a 60-80 degree inclination with the intaglio surface facing towards the build platform. Upper Try-in Dentures should be oriented so that the posterior region is closest to the build platform. Lower Try-in Dentures should be oriented so that the anterior region is closest to the build platform.
