Category is uncategorised. Asiga printer costs.
Once you purchase the Asiga printer, there are no ongoing costs, such as service or warranty fees, software license fees, parts that wear out overtime or any other hidden costs, compared to some other manufacturers. The only costs are for consumables, resin and build trays. And even for the resin, Asiga is fully open source, meaning you can use any suitable third party resin, not just Asiga resins.
