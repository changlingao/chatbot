Network troubleshooting for MAX X when printer is not detected in Composer 
If the printer is connected to the network but not showing up in Composer, check that Composer is connected to the same network as your printer.
When you favourite (star) a printer, Composer remembers the IP Address. If the IP Address has changed, that connection can be lost.
1. Unfavourite the printer by clicking on the yellow star.
2. Refresh the Build Properties window.
3. The printer should be visible now.
