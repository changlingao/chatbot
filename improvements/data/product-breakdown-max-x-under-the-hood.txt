Product breakdown of MAX X under the hood
1. Build Platform Holder
The build platform holder is the arm that protrudes from the vertical stage. 
2. Build Platform
The build platform is the centerpiece of the MAX X. It is engineered from anodised steel making it extremely durable.
3. Basin
The basin holds the resin tray and acts as a gateway between the resin and UV light. This glass plate must be kept crystal clean and free from debris. For more information on cleaning the basin glass, please visit: https://support.asiga.com/maintenance-schedule-max-x/#cleaning-the-glass-surfaces
4. Build Tray
Build trays contain the resin during the printing process. They are comprised of a flexible film that moves with the build platform. Asiga recommends one Build Tray per material. Do not use the same Build Tray for multiple materials as this may create material cross-contamination and transfer of uncured materials. For more information on maintaining the build tray, visit https://support.asiga.com/maintaining-the-build-tray-max-x/
5. Build Tray Clamps
The clamps are designed to hold the basin in place during the printing process.
6. SPS™ Positioning Encoders
Asiga SPS™ technology is managed by 4 position encoders that surround the basin glass. These sensors detect actual build platform positioning to ensure the layers in your 3D printed part are formed accurately.
