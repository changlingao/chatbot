MAX Heater issues part2
Although the material.ini file suggests a temperature of 40째C, in most cases, this level of heat is not necessary; lower temperatures will yield similar results.
We could send you a replacement heater board and heater element to exchange in this machine. However, even with these replacements, we cannot guarantee that the printer will reach temperatures greater than 35째C. You might want to consider explaining the situation to the customer and advising them that, for future prints, the heating process can be skipped once the printer reaches 26째C or 30째C.
