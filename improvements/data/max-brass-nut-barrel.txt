MAX Brass nut barrel
If there are issues with the platform holder, you may be able to change just the brass nut, calibration screw, and washers. Borrow one temporarily from another printer to check if this resolves the problem. Otherwise, you will need to replace the entire platform holder, which costs a bit more.
