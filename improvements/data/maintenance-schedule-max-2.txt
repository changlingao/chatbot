Cleaning glass surfaces on the MAX
You should regularly inspect the mirror underneath the glass basin as this can attract dust, which may cause print defects. If the glass is dirty, you should:
1. Remove the basin by unscrewing the 4 screws shown in the following image: https://support.asiga.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/max-basin-right.jpg
2. Carefully blow away the dust. Avoid touching the mirror as it may smudge.
If the mirror is too dirty, consider replacing it.
