PRO 4K Approach failed since platform is not sufficiently tight
The build platform is subject to a lot of forces during the printing process. If the platform is not sufficiently tight & can move during printing, it will cause obstructions.
1. Ensure the knob is tight before starting a print. See the following image for reference: https://support.asiga.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pro-4k-build-platform-knob.jpg
2. If the build platform is not completely flat against the glass, it will cause an obstruction. This means that one side of the platform touches the glass first. Please check the platform calibration by following this video: https://player.vimeo.com/video/740582352
