PRO 4K approach failed due to debris in the build tray or on the surface of the build platform.
Debris can restrict the build platform from reaching its destination. This debris can be caused by parts detaching during printing and floating around. The best way to avoid any debris in the build tray is by performing a build tray clean.
Please refer to the following video on how to clean the build tray: https://player.vimeo.com/video/741725965
