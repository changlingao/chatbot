Category is Trays. Reducing tray dimples.
Please try the following:
- Set the Light Intensity in the Advanced Parameters to 2mW
- Set the Separation Acceleration to 0.1mm/s
- Run a print with these parameters and see if the dimples reduce or disappear entirely
- If they do disappear, then you can increase the Separation Acceleration to 0.2mm/s
When doing these adjustments, enable the Fast Print Mode and Separation Detect, to compensate for reduced printing speeds.
