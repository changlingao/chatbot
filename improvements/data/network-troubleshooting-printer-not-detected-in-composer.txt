Network troubleshooting for printer not detected in Composer
If the printer is connected to the network but not showing up in Composer, check that it is connected to the same network as your printer.
When you favourite (star) a printer, Composer remembers the IP Address. If the IP Address has changed, that connection can be lost.
- Unfavourite the printer by clicking on the yellow star.
- Refresh the Build Properties window.
Printer should now be visible. If you are still experiencing technical difficulties please launch a support ticket via https://myaccount.asiga.com/accounts/support/0/.
