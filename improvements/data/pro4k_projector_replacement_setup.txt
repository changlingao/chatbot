Category is PRO4K. Projector replacement setup.
To swap the projector you will need the tools in the PRO 4K Reseller Service Toolkit PN/05226, and a radiometer to check the light intensity. Please make sure you have these tools, otherwise it will be necessary to order them to be able to exchange the projector, and set it up properly.
