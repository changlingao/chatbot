1. Remove the Micro SD card from the motherboard.
2. Ensure that all the contacts on the card are clean.
3. Reinsert the card and check if this resolves the issue.
If the printer still doesn't boot after checking the Micro SD card, it is likely that the microSD card is faulty. In this case:
1. Remove the microSD card from the printer.
2. Recover the printer.ini file by placing the microSD card in a card reader on a Windows PC.
3. Run the recovery tool, and when it detects the card, select a location to save the printer.ini file on the PC.
4. Do not format any partitions if prompted by Windows when inserting the microSD card.
5. Attach the printer.ini file to the support ticket. We will need it to prepare a replacement Micro SD card for the printer.
