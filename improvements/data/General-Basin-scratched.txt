Category is General. What to do when basin is scratched
If the glass is only lightly scratched, the print results may not be adversely affected. Please check by printing, if the damage to the glass is affecting the printed results. If it is, it would be necessary to change the basin by ordering a replacement basin at our website.

If there is resin on the glass, no replacement is needed and the glass just needs cleaning.
