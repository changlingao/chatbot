Before unboxing your PRO 4K or PRO 4K XL
Choose a stable and clean workspace for your PRO 4K. A location away from any sources of vibration or dust is preferable. Operating your 3D printer next to a milling machine is not recommended and might cause performance issues. Prepare a clean, dry space out of direct sunlight to store resin bottles and trays. Asiga recommends using the Build Tray Storage Cases for safe storage of Build Trays.
