Product Breakdown for PRO 4K under the hood
1. Build Platform Holder
The build platform holder is the arm that protrudes from the vertical stage.
2. Build Platform
The build platform is the centerpiece of the PRO 4K. It is engineered from anodised steel which makes it extremely durable.
3. Basin
The basin holds the resin tray and acts as a gateway between the resin and UV light. This glass plate must be kept crystal clean and free from debris. For more information on cleaning the basin glass, visit https://support.asiga.com/maintenance-schedule-pro-4k/#cleaning-the-glass-surface
4. Build Tray Sliders
Anodised steel sliders to hold the build tray in place during printing.
5. Build Tray
Build trays contain the resin during the printing process. They are constructed of a flexible film within a rigid plastic frame. For more information on maintaining the build tray, visit https://support.asiga.com/maintaining-the-build-tray-pro-4k/
Asiga recommends one Build Tray per material. Do not use the same Build Tray for multiple materials as this may create material cross-contamination and transfer of uncured materials.
6. SPS™ Positioning Encoders
Asiga SPS™ technology is managed by 4 position encoders that surround the basin glass. These sensors detect actual build platform positioning to ensure the layers in your 3D printed part are formed accurately.
