Category is Resins. Fusion Gray personalised recommendation step two. 
Place the build tray with resin into the microwave for 20 seconds, full power (1000W), take it out and you will see that the resin will come out really smooth. If you still see little grains, then you can run it for another 15-20 seconds. This method is only recommended if the customer could do so without damaging the RFID tag. Otherwise they would need to apply the 3 ways mentioned in the IFU.
