Multi-Stacking
Multi-stacking allows you to take full advantage of the printer Z height to increase production throughput. Print single layers through the day and then Multi-stack for an overnight build to utilise the time when you are not in the office.
You can refer to the following video for directions on how to set up multi-stacking: https://player.vimeo.com/video/744845556
