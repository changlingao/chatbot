MAX Deflection calibration
Please check both the encoder calibration and the deflection calibration in the following link. https://myaccount.asiga.com/accounts/resources/MAX/1%20-%20Quick%20Start%20Guide/MAX%20User%20Guide%2020220211.pdf
The encoder calibration is shown on page 56 and the deflection calibration is shown on page 64.
After this, you should be able to perform the platform calibration.
