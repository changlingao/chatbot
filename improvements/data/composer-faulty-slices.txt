Composer Faulty slices
When you encounter the "Faulty slices" error, you can click on "Show Details." If Composer indicates that the error message is related to the STM file, it won't cause any issues. This simply means that the supports on the model are overlapping, and Composer mistakenly identifies them as "Faulty slices."
However, if the error pertains to "faulty slices," indicating that the file contains multiple faulty layers, Composer will attempt to replace the faulty slices with the last working one. If there are too many faulty slices, you may experience unexpected print outcomes. You can repair these files in your design software using functions such as mesh repair, mesh healing, boolean operations, etc.
