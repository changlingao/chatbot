Category is PRO4K. DMD and I2C errors.
The errors indicate the LED driver board is faulty. We will send you a replacement board free of charge and shipping. Please fill in the form sent with the replacement board and return it with the old driver board. There is a non-return fee of $350USD that becomes payable if the old board is not returned to Asiga within 30 days. Let us know once the exchange is done, so we can generate the RMA documents to return the board and remove the fee.
