Composer Fast print
The fast print mode will move the platform more quickly whenever possible and enable separation detection by default. It does not affect the accuracy of the printing.
It's always safe to enable the Fast Print Mode, but you should disable Separation Detection for testing if you encounter print issues.
The change here involves adding "detection" after "separation" to clarify the action being performed.
