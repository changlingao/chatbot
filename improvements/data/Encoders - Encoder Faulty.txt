Category is Encoders. Faulty encoders.
1. Temporarily swap the two rear encoders plugged into the board.
2. Check whether the side of encoder that is not working responds when plugged into the other position on the encoder board.
3. Perform the calibration as a way of checking the encoder.
4. If the back right encoder 2 responds when plugged into the other receptacle 3, then the issue would be the board, not the encoder.
5. However, if the back right encoder does not respond regardless of which receptacle it is plugged into, then the issue will be the encoder, not the board.

If the board/encoder is broken please send a further inquiry.
